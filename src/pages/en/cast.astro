              <p class="text-[#bfae9e] mb-4">Artistic director of cirque d’hiver de Paris</p>
              <p class="text-sm md:text-base text-white leading-relaxed font-light">Born into the Cirque d'Hiver family, he regularly accompanied circus tours during school holidays.<br>Started learning basic circus disciplines, juggling, acrobatics, and horseback riding at the age of 12, and also studied music (piano and trumpet).<br>
                Made his stage debut as a ring boy, participated in acrobatic acts, and performed pony acts.<br>
                At the age of 16, he began creating the act that would make him famous, "Fil de Feriste."<br>
                Performed this act for the first time the day after his 18th birthday, initially on the Bouglione Circus tour, and later worldwide from circuses to cabarets and music halls, especially at the Cirque Roncalli in Germany, where he performed for 15 years.<br>
                In 1984, Joseph was welcomed by the then Minister of Culture, Jack Lang, and received the French Circus Grand Prix, being recognized as the best French circus artist.<br>
                Subsequently, he participated in the Monte Carlo World Circus Festival twice, in 1985 and 1996.<br>
                In 1999, he presented his first show as artistic director, "Salt," at the Cirque d'Hiver in Paris, challenging himself to show his artistry and ability to lead a large team to the audience and circus members, and succeeded.<br>
                This was followed by the production of shows such as "Piste," "Trapeze," and "Le Cirque" (a show commemorating the 150th anniversary of the founding of Cirque d'Hiver).<br>
                A total of about 20 works have already been performed at the Cirque d'Hiver.<br>
                He has also produced over 100 shows worldwide, including in China, India, the United States, the Netherlands, Mexico, Spain, and the United Kingdom.<br>
                In 2003, he was knighted with the National Order of Merit, and in 2019, under the patronage of Princess Stephanie of Monaco, he received the Circus Ambassador Award from the World Circus Federation.<br><br>
